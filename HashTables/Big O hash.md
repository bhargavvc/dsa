You're absolutely right in how you're walking through the Big O complexity of hash tables. Let me expand on each of these points in a clear and structured way to explain why hash tables are generally considered O(1) for most operations, and how linked lists affect their performance in handling collisions.

### Big O of Hash Table Operations (Using Linked Lists for Collision Resolution)

#### 1. **Hashing Function: O(1)**
The **hash function** takes a key (usually a string or number) and converts it into an integer address in the table. This is done by iterating over each character of the key, multiplying by a constant, and modding by the table size. Since:
   - The hash function always performs a fixed number of operations per character.
   - The key size is usually small and fixed.
   
Therefore, we assume that the **hash function itself has a time complexity of O(1)**. This is constant time because regardless of the size of the table or the key, the hash function performs a consistent number of operations to produce an index.

#### 2. **Setting an Item (Insert Operation): O(1)**
- When you insert a new key-value pair into the hash table, you first calculate the hash of the key (O(1) time).
- Then, you go to the computed index, which also takes O(1) time.
- If no collision occurs (i.e., the index is empty), you simply insert the key-value pair in O(1) time.
- If a collision occurs, and youâ€™re using **separate chaining with linked lists**, you append the new key-value pair to the linked list. Appending to the end of a linked list takes O(1) time.

Thus, **inserting an item is typically O(1)** on average, assuming relatively few collisions.

#### 3. **Getting an Item (Lookup Operation): O(1)**
- To look up a key, you first compute the hash of the key (O(1)).
- Then, you access the corresponding index in the hash table (O(1)).
  
If there is no collision, the item will be the first (and only) one at that index, and you can retrieve it in O(1) time. **So, for the average case, lookups are O(1)**.

#### 4. **Worst Case: O(n) Due to Collisions**
- If you have many collisions (i.e., multiple key-value pairs hashed to the same index), the hash table must store these values in a linked list at that index.
- In the **worst case scenario**, every key could hash to the same index, meaning the entire table is just a linked list at one position. 
  - In this case, searching for a key would require traversing the linked list, which takes O(n) time, where **n** is the number of items in the hash table.
  
However, **the worst-case scenario is rare**, especially if you have a good hash function that distributes keys evenly across the table and you keep the table size proportional to the number of elements (keeping the load factor low).

### Collisions: Separate Chaining vs Open Addressing
The way you handle collisions affects the complexity of your hash table:

#### a. **Separate Chaining (with Linked Lists)**
- As we discussed, separate chaining means each index of the hash table holds a linked list (or another data structure) of key-value pairs in case of collisions.
- **Average Case**: O(1) if the load factor is low and collisions are rare.
- **Worst Case**: O(n) if all keys hash to the same index and form a long linked list.

#### b. **Open Addressing (Linear Probing, Quadratic Probing)**
- Instead of storing a linked list at each index, open addressing finds the next available slot in the table when a collision occurs.
  - **Linear Probing**: You search sequentially for the next empty slot.
  - **Quadratic Probing**: You search using quadratic steps to reduce clustering.
  
In these methods:
- **Average Case**: O(1), assuming good hash function and low load factor.
- **Worst Case**: O(n), if the table is nearly full, causing many probes to find an empty slot.

### Why Is Hash Table Considered O(1) on Average?

1. **Good Hash Function**: The hash function spreads keys evenly across the available indices, leading to few collisions.
2. **Load Factor**: The table is resized (rehashing) when the load factor (ratio of the number of items to the table size) gets too high. This ensures the number of collisions remains low, keeping operations O(1) on average.
3. **Efficient Probing/Chaining**: Even in cases of collisions, the way we resolve them (chaining or probing) generally keeps operations fast as long as collisions are infrequent.

### Comparison with Other Data Structures

1. **List (or List of Lists)**:
   - Lookup: O(n) since you must iterate over the list to find a key.
   - Insertion: O(1) if you append at the end, but O(n) if you insert at a specific position.
   - Memory: A simple list is memory efficient but not suited for fast lookups or large datasets.

2. **List of Dictionaries**:
   - Lookup and Insert are O(1) on average for dictionaries because they are hash tables themselves.
   - Memory usage is higher due to storing multiple dictionaries, but they offer fast performance for small sets of data.

3. **Linked Lists**:
   - Lookup: O(n) because you must traverse the list sequentially.
   - Insert: O(1) at the beginning or end.
   - Used in separate chaining for hash tables to handle collisions, but not ideal as a standalone lookup structure.

4. **Dictionaries** (Python's Built-in `dict`):
   - **Average Case**: O(1) for both insert and lookup, thanks to Python's efficient hash table implementation.
   - **Worst Case**: O(n) if too many collisions occur, but Python handles resizing and rehashing dynamically to avoid this.

### Conclusion:
- **Hash Tables (Separate Chaining)**: O(1) on average for insertion and lookup, but O(n) in the worst case.
- **Hash Tables (Open Addressing)**: Also O(1) on average but can degrade to O(n) with high load factors.
- **Dictionaries (Python `dict`)**: The most optimized and efficient, with O(1) on average and very good handling of collisions.

Thus, **for fast lookups and memory efficiency**, a hash table (especially Python's built-in `dict`) is generally the best choice in most scenarios due to its average-case O(1) time complexity. Other structures like lists or linked lists might be useful in specific cases but aren't as efficient for lookup-heavy operations.
