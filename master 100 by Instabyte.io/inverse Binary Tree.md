**Problem Statement:**

Given a binary tree represented as a list in level-order traversal, invert the binary tree and return its level-order traversal after inversion. Inverting a binary tree means swapping the left and right children of all nodes in the tree.

**Example:**

- **Input:** `[4, 2, 7, 1, 3, 6, 9]`
- **Output:** `[4, 7, 2, 9, 6, 3, 1]`

**Best Approach to Solve the Problem:**

1. **Construct the Binary Tree from the Level-Order Traversal:**

   - Use the input list to build the binary tree node by node, maintaining the correct parent-child relationships as per level-order traversal.

2. **Invert the Binary Tree:**

   - Perform a traversal (recursive or iterative) of the binary tree.
   - At each node, swap its left and right child nodes.

3. **Perform Level-Order Traversal on the Inverted Tree:**

   - After inverting the tree, perform a level-order traversal to get the list representation of the inverted tree.

**Time and Space Complexity and Explanation of the Logic:**

1. **Constructing the Binary Tree:**

   - **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of nodes.
     - Each node is visited once to build the tree.
   - **Space Complexity:** O(n)
     - Space is used to store the nodes and their references in the tree.

2. **Inverting the Binary Tree:**

   - **Time Complexity:** O(n)
     - Each node is visited once to swap its children.
   - **Space Complexity:**
     - O(h) for recursive approach, where h is the height of the tree (due to call stack).
     - O(n) in the worst case for an unbalanced tree.
     - For iterative approach using a queue or stack, space complexity is O(n).

3. **Level-Order Traversal of the Inverted Tree:**

   - **Time Complexity:** O(n)
     - Each node is visited once to perform the traversal.
   - **Space Complexity:** O(n)
     - A queue is used to hold nodes at each level.

**Logic Explanation:**

- **Tree Construction:**

  - Use a queue to keep track of nodes whose children are yet to be added.
  - Iterate through the input list, create tree nodes, and assign them as left or right children accordingly.

- **Tree Inversion:**

  - Use recursion or iteration to traverse the tree.
  - At each node, swap the left and right child pointers.

- **Level-Order Traversal:**

  - Use a queue to perform breadth-first traversal.
  - Collect the values of nodes in a list as they are visited.

**Why This Approach Was Chosen and Key Takeaways:**

- **Simplicity and Clarity:**

  - Breaking the problem into smaller, manageable tasks (construction, inversion, traversal) simplifies the solution.
  - Each step is straightforward and can be tested independently.

- **Efficiency:**

  - The approach is time-efficient, with linear time complexity.
  - Space usage is optimized as much as possible.

- **Reusability:**

  - Functions for tree inversion and traversal are common operations and can be reused in other contexts.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Understanding Tree Structures:**

  - Building and manipulating binary trees are fundamental skills in computer science.

- **Recursion vs. Iteration:**

  - Recursive solutions can be elegant but may have higher space complexity due to call stack usage.
  - Iterative solutions can sometimes be more efficient in terms of space.

- **Breadth-First Traversal:**

  - Level-order traversal is useful when dealing with tree representations in lists or arrays.

**Real-Time Scenarios Where This Approach Helps:**

- **Mirror Images in Graphics:**

  - Inverting trees can simulate mirror images in graphical applications.

- **Network Routing and Hierarchical Data:**

  - Modifying tree structures is common in networking and data organization.

- **Algorithm Design:**

  - Understanding tree inversion aids in designing algorithms that require tree manipulation, such as balancing trees or modifying search algorithms.

**Implementation Example in Python:**

```python
from collections import deque

# Define the TreeNode class
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

# Function to build the tree from level-order traversal
def build_tree(level_order):
    if not level_order:
        return None

    root = TreeNode(level_order[0])
    queue = deque([root])
    i = 1

    while queue and i < len(level_order):
        current = queue.popleft()

        # Add left child
        if i < len(level_order):
            left_val = level_order[i]
            if left_val is not None:
                current.left = TreeNode(left_val)
                queue.append(current.left)
            i += 1

        # Add right child
        if i < len(level_order):
            right_val = level_order[i]
            if right_val is not None:
                current.right = TreeNode(right_val)
                queue.append(current.right)
            i += 1

    return root

# Function to invert the binary tree
def invert_tree(node):
    if node is None:
        return None
    # Swap the left and right children
    node.left, node.right = invert_tree(node.right), invert_tree(node.left)
    return node

# Function for level-order traversal
def level_order_traversal(root):
    result = []
    queue = deque([root])

    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        if current:
            result.append(current.val)
            queue.append(current.left)
            queue.append(current.right)
        else:
            result.append(None)

    # Remove trailing Nones
    while result and result[-1] is None:
        result.pop()

    return result

# Input
proper_array = [4, 2, 7, 1, 3, 6, 9]

# Build the tree
root = build_tree(proper_array)

# Invert the tree
invert_tree(root)

# Get the level-order traversal of the inverted tree
output = level_order_traversal(root)
print(output)
```

**Output:**

```
[4, 7, 2, 9, 6, 3, 1]
```

This approach effectively constructs the binary tree, inverts it by swapping the left and right children of each node, and then performs a level-order traversal to produce the desired output.
