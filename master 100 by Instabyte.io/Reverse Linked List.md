Certainly! Here's a detailed 7-step explanation for reversing a linked list.

---

### **1. Problem Statement**

- **Objective**: Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list and return the reversed list.
- **Constraints**:
  - The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 5000]`.
  - `-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000`

---

### **2. Understanding the Problem**

- **Linked List**: A linear data structure where each element (node) points to the next node, forming a sequence.
- **Reversing**: Changing the direction of the pointers so that the last node becomes the first, and the first becomes the last.
- **Goal**: Modify the pointers of the linked list to reverse its order.

---

### **3. Algorithm Explanation**

- **Iterative Approach**:
  - **Initialize**:
    - Set two pointers:
      - `prev` to `None` (will become the new tail of the reversed list).
      - `current` to `head` (starting point of the original list).
  - **Iteration**:
    - While `current` is not `None`:
      - Store the next node: `next_node = current.next`.
      - Reverse the link: `current.next = prev`.
      - Move `prev` and `current` one step forward:
        - `prev = current`.
        - `current = next_node`.
  - **Result**:
    - `prev` will point to the new head of the reversed list.

---

### **4. Implementation**

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def reverseList(head):
    prev = None            # Step 1: Initialize prev to None
    current = head         # Step 2: Initialize current to head
    while current:         # Step 3: Iterate over the list
        next_node = current.next   # Step 4: Store next node
        current.next = prev        # Step 5: Reverse the link
        prev = current             # Step 6: Move prev to current
        current = next_node        # Step 7: Move current to next_node
    return prev             # Step 8: Return prev as new head
```

### **5. Complexity Analysis**

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - We traverse each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - No additional space proportional to input size is used; only a few pointers are utilized.

---

### **6. Test Cases**

#### **Test Case 1**

- **Input**: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`
- **Process**:
  - After reversal: `5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1`
- **Output**: Head of the reversed list pointing to node with value `5`.

#### **Test Case 2**

- **Input**: `None` (empty list)
- **Process**:
  - The list is empty; reversing it results in an empty list.
- **Output**: `None`

#### **Test Case 3**

- **Input**: `1`
- **Process**:
  - Single node; reversing it results in the same node.
- **Output**: Head pointing to node with value `1`.

### **7. Detailed Explanation**

- **Step-by-Step Execution (Test Case 1)**:

  - **Initial State**:
    - `prev = None`
    - `current = Node(1)`
  - **First Iteration**:
    - `next_node = current.next` (`Node(2)`)
    - `current.next = prev` (`None`)
    - `prev = current` (`Node(1)`)
    - `current = next_node` (`Node(2)`)
  - **Second Iteration**:
    - `next_node = current.next` (`Node(3)`)
    - `current.next = prev` (`Node(1)`)
    - `prev = current` (`Node(2)`)
    - `current = next_node` (`Node(3)`)
  - **Third Iteration**:
    - `next_node = current.next` (`Node(4)`)
    - `current.next = prev` (`Node(2)`)
    - `prev = current` (`Node(3)`)
    - `current = next_node` (`Node(4)`)
  - **Fourth Iteration**:
    - `next_node = current.next` (`Node(5)`)
    - `current.next = prev` (`Node(3)`)
    - `prev = current` (`Node(4)`)
    - `current = next_node` (`Node(5)`)
  - **Fifth Iteration**:
    - `next_node = current.next` (`None`)
    - `current.next = prev` (`Node(4)`)
    - `prev = current` (`Node(5)`)
    - `current = next_node` (`None`)
  - **Termination**:
    - `current` is `None`, exit loop.
    - `prev` points to `Node(5)`, which is the new head.

- **Visualization**:

  - **Before Reversal**:
    - `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> None`
  - **After Reversal**:
    - `5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> None`

- **Key Points**:
  - We reverse the `next` pointer of each node to point to its previous node.
  - At each step, we carefully manage the pointers to avoid losing access to the remaining nodes.
  - The original `head` becomes the tail of the reversed list, pointing to `None`.

---

**Note**:

- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Empty List**: If `head` is `None`, the function returns `None`.
  - **Single Node**: If the list has only one node, the reversed list is the same as the original.

- **Recursive Approach** (Alternative):

  - **Algorithm**:
    - Base case: If `head` is `None` or `head.next` is `None`, return `head`.
    - Recursively reverse the rest of the list.
    - Adjust pointers:
      - `head.next.next = head`
      - `head.next = None`
    - Return the new head from recursion.

  - **Implementation**:

    ```python
    def reverseListRecursive(head):
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head
        reversed_head = reverseListRecursive(head.next)
        head.next.next = head
        head.next = None
        return reversed_head
    ```

  - **Complexity**:
    - **Time Complexity**: O(n)
    - **Space Complexity**: O(n) due to recursive call stack.

---

**Summary**:

- The iterative method efficiently reverses a singly linked list in linear time with constant space.
- By manipulating pointers, we change the direction of the list without using extra memory.
- Understanding pointer manipulation is crucial in linked list operations.
