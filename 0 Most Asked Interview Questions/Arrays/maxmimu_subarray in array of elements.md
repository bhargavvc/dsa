## **Maximum Subarray Problem using Kadane’s Algorithm**

### **Problem Statement:**

Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

**Example:**
- **Input:** `[-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]`
- **Output:** `6`
- **Explanation:** `[4,-1,2,1]` has the largest sum = 6.

### **1. My Initial Approach (Brute Force):**

When I first approached this problem, my initial idea was to iterate through each element and compute the sum of all possible subarrays starting from each index. Here's how I thought about it:

1. For each element, I would start by taking its value as the starting sum.
2. I then iterated through the subsequent elements, adding them to the current sum.
3. I would compare each subarray sum with the current maximum sum and update the maximum whenever a larger sum was found.

#### **Key Observations about Brute Force:**

- **Time Complexity:** \( O(N^2) \) because for each starting index, I’m summing up all possible subarrays in a nested loop.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(1) \) because I’m only using a few extra variables for calculations.
- **Limitation:** The approach becomes inefficient for large arrays due to the nested loops.

### **Brute Force Code Implementation:**

```python
def max_subarray(nums):
    array_len = len(nums) - 1
    current_max = float("-inf")
    
    for index in range(array_len):
        ele_iter_max = float("-inf")
        sub_iter = index + 1

        while sub_iter <= array_len + 1: 
            iter_max = sum(nums[index:sub_iter + 1])
            if iter_max > ele_iter_max:
                ele_iter_max = iter_max
            sub_iter += 1
        if ele_iter_max > current_max:
            current_max = ele_iter_max

    return current_max

nums = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]
print(max_subarray(nums))
```

### **2. Refinement with Kadane’s Algorithm:**

**What I Learned:**

The brute-force approach successfully finds the maximum sum, but it’s not efficient. The main limitation was that I was re-summing the subarrays multiple times in the nested loops. This led me to explore Kadane’s Algorithm, which optimizes the process by avoiding unnecessary recalculations.

**Key Insight of Kadane’s Algorithm:**

The goal of Kadane’s Algorithm is to efficiently track the maximum sum of contiguous subarrays by making a decision at each element. Instead of considering all possible subarrays, the algorithm dynamically chooses whether to extend the current subarray or start a new one.

### **How Kadane’s Algorithm Works:**

1. **Initialize the Starting State:** 
   Begin with the first element as both `current_sum` and `current_max` since, at the start, our largest subarray consists of only that one element.

2. **Iterate Through the Array:**
   For each element:
   - **Decide:** Should we extend the current subarray to include this element (`current_sum + nums[i]`) or start fresh with just the current element (`nums[i]`)? We do this by comparing these two values.
   - **Update the Current Maximum Sum:** If the new `current_sum` is larger than the current maximum (`current_max`), we update it.

3. **Return the Maximum Sum:** At the end of the iteration, `current_max` holds the largest sum of any contiguous subarray.

---

### **Why Kadane’s Algorithm Works:**

#### **Key Logic:**

1. **Dynamic Decision at Each Step**:
   At each element, we decide:
   - **Should we extend the current subarray** by adding the current element (`current_sum + num`)?
   - **Or should we start a new subarray** with the current element (`num`)?

   This decision is made using:
   ```python
   current_sum = max(num, current_sum + num)
   ```

   If it’s better to include the current element in the ongoing subarray, then `current_sum` continues to grow by including this element. However, if the current element alone is greater than the sum of the ongoing subarray, `current_sum` is reset to just this element, indicating a new subarray starts here.

2. **Tracking the Maximum Sum**:
   After updating `current_sum`, we compare it with the global maximum sum (`current_max`):
   ```python
   current_max = max(current_max, current_sum)
   ```

   This step ensures that at each point in the array, `current_max` holds the highest sum of any subarray encountered so far.

### **Conceptual Visualization of Kadane’s Logic:**

As you iterate through each element, ask yourself:
- **Does adding this element to my current sum make things better?**
- If **yes**, you continue; otherwise, you discard the current subarray and start fresh from the current element.

### **Key Points to Remember:**

1. **Contiguous Subarray Concept:** The problem focuses on contiguous subarrays, not just any combination of numbers from the array.
2. **Dynamic Decisions:** Kadane’s Algorithm makes dynamic decisions about whether to include the current element in the ongoing subarray or start a new one.
3. **Global Maximum Update:** At each step, the algorithm updates `current_max` to ensure it holds the highest sum encountered so far.

### **Time and Space Complexity of Kadane’s Algorithm:**

- **Time Complexity:** \( O(N) \) because we iterate through the array exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(1) \) because we only use a few extra variables (`current_sum` and `current_max`).

### **Kadane’s Algorithm Code with Comments:**

```python
def max_subarray(nums):
    # Initialize the starting state with the first element
    current_sum = nums[0]
    current_max = nums[0]
    
    # Initialize variables to track the subarray indices
    start = end = temp_start = 0

    # Iterate through the rest of the array
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        # Decide whether to start a new subarray at nums[i]
        if nums[i] > current_sum + nums[i]:
            current_sum = nums[i]
            temp_start = i
        else:
            current_sum += nums[i]

        # Update the maximum sum if the current sum is greater
        if current_sum > current_max:
            current_max = current_sum
            start = temp_start
            end = i

    # Return the maximum sum and the corresponding subarray
    return current_max, nums[start:end + 1]
```
