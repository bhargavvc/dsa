def search_num_in_array(nums, target):

    left = 0
    right = len(nums)-1

    while left < right:
        mid = (left+right)//2

        if nums[mid] == target:
            return nums[mid]

        if nums[mid] < target:
            left +=1
        if nums[mid] > target:
            right -=1

    return nums[left]
        

nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
print(search_num_in_array(nums,4))

1. **While Loop Condition**: The condition `left < right` in the while loop is correct, but it might cause the loop to miss checking the last possible index when `left == right`. This scenario can occur if the target is at the last position where `left` and `right` converge.

2. **Condition Handling**:
   - When you find that `nums[mid] < target`, you correctly attempt to move the `left` index up by increasing it (`left += 1`).
   - When `nums[mid] > target`, you decrease the `right` index (`right -= 1`).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the target number is greater than all elements, your function will stop at the last element but might not necessarily indicate that the target isn't found.
   - If the target number is smaller than all elements, the function will return the first element, which isn't accurate if the target is not in the list.

4. **Commented Code**: The commented out `if` statement inside the loop (`if nums[mid] == target: return nums[mid]`) is actually crucial for correctly identifying when the target is found.

Hereâ€™s a revised version of your function that handles these issues:

```python
def search_num_in_array(nums, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(nums) - 1

    while left <= right:  # Change this to `<=` to ensure all indices are checked
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] == target:
            return nums[mid] 
        elif nums[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1  # Adjust to `mid + 1` to avoid infinite loop or incorrect skipping
        else:
            right = mid - 1 

    return -1  
    
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(search_num_in_array(nums, 4))  # This should correctly print 4
print(search_num_in_array(nums, 7))  # This should return -1 indicating the target isn't found
```

In this version, the loop now checks using `left <= right` which ensures that the middle index where `left` and `right` converge is checked. The conditions inside the loop are updated to adjust `left` and `right` correctly, avoiding any potential infinite loops and ensuring the loop progresses properly. Lastly, it returns `-1` if the target isn't found after exiting the loop, which is a common practice to indicate unsuccessful searches.
