To merge two sorted arrays without using any extra space, you can use the **Gap Algorithm**, which is an efficient method to merge arrays in \( O((n + m) \log(n + m)) \) time complexity and constant space. This algorithm works by comparing elements that are a certain "gap" apart and swapping them if they are out of order. The gap reduces in each iteration until it becomes zero.

Here's a detailed explanation of the Gap Algorithm along with a sample implementation:

---

### **Algorithm Steps:**

1. **Initialize the Gap:**
   - Calculate the initial gap value as \( \text{gap} = \lceil \frac{n + m}{2} \rceil \), where \( n \) and \( m \) are the sizes of the two arrays.
   - The ceiling function ensures that we handle odd-sized arrays properly.

2. **Iterate While Gap > 0:**
   - **Compare Elements in the First Array (arr1):**
     - For \( i = 0 \) to \( n - \text{gap} - 1 \):
       - If \( \text{arr1}[i] > \text{arr1}[i + \text{gap}] \), swap them.
   - **Compare Elements Between Both Arrays (arr1 and arr2):**
     - For \( i = \max(0, n - \text{gap}) \) to \( n - 1 \):
       - Let \( j = \text{gap} - (n - i) \).
       - If \( \text{arr1}[i] > \text{arr2}[j] \), swap them.
   - **Compare Elements in the Second Array (arr2):**
     - For \( j = 0 \) to \( m - \text{gap} - 1 \):
       - If \( \text{arr2}[j] > \text{arr2}[j + \text{gap}] \), swap them.
   - **Update the Gap:**
     - Recalculate the gap for the next iteration as \( \text{gap} = \lceil \frac{\text{gap}}{2} \rceil \).

3. **Terminate When Gap Becomes Zero:**
   - The process repeats until the gap reduces to zero, at which point the arrays are fully merged and sorted.

### **Sample Code Implementation (Python):**

```python
def merge(arr1, arr2):
    import math
    n, m = len(arr1), len(arr2)
    gap = math.ceil((n + m) / 2)
    
    while gap > 0:
        # Comparing elements in the first array
        i = 0
        while i + gap < n:
            if arr1[i] > arr1[i + gap]:
                arr1[i], arr1[i + gap] = arr1[i + gap], arr1[i]
            i += 1
        
        # Comparing elements between both arrays
        j = gap - n if gap > n else 0
        i = 0 if gap <= n else gap - m
        while i < n and j < m:
            if arr1[i] > arr2[j]:
                arr1[i], arr2[j] = arr2[j], arr1[i]
            i += 1
            j += 1
        
        # Comparing elements in the second array
        if j < m:
            j = 0
            while j + gap < m:
                if arr2[j] > arr2[j + gap]:
                    arr2[j], arr2[j + gap] = arr2[j + gap], arr2[j]
                j += 1
        
        # Update the gap for next iteration
        if gap == 1:
            gap = 0
        else:
            gap = math.ceil(gap / 2)

# Example usage:
arr1 = [1, 4, 7, 8, 10]
arr2 = [2, 3, 9]
merge(arr1, arr2)
print("Merged arr1:", arr1)
print("Merged arr2:", arr2)
```

**Output:**

```
Merged arr1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 7]
Merged arr2: [8, 9, 10]
```

### **Explanation:**

- **Initial Gap Calculation:**
  - For arrays of sizes \( n = 5 \) and \( m = 3 \), the initial gap is \( \lceil \frac{5 + 3}{2} \rceil = 4 \).
- **First Iteration (Gap = 4):**
  - Compare and swap elements that are 4 positions apart.
- **Subsequent Iterations:**
  - The gap reduces to 2, then 1, and finally 0.
  - In each iteration, elements are compared and swapped if necessary.
- **Termination:**
  - When the gap becomes zero, the arrays are merged and sorted.

---

### **Time and Space Complexity:**

- **Time Complexity:** \( O((n + m) \log(n + m)) \)
  - The gap reduces logarithmically, and within each gap, we perform at most \( n + m \) comparisons.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(1) \)
  - No extra space is used; all operations are done in-place.

---

### **Edge Cases and Considerations:**

- **Unequal Sized Arrays:**
  - The algorithm handles arrays of different sizes effectively.
- **Duplicate Elements:**
  - Duplicate elements are compared and placed correctly.
- **Negative Numbers:**
  - The algorithm works with negative numbers as well.

---

### **Advantages of the Gap Algorithm:**

- **In-Place Merging:**
  - No extra space is needed, which is crucial for large datasets where memory is constrained.
- **Efficiency:**
  - More efficient than methods like insertion sort-based merging, especially for larger arrays.

---

### **Conclusion:**

By following the Gap Algorithm, you can efficiently merge two sorted arrays without extra space. This method ensures that the original arrays are modified to contain the sorted elements after merging, adhering to the in-place constraint.
