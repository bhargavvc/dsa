- Hash table for efficient lookup
```python
class Solution: 
    def twoSum(self, nums: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:
        num_dict = {}    # O(1) time, O(n) space (Dictionary to store number:index pairs)
        
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):  # O(n) time
            complement = target - num    
            if complement in num_dict:    # O(1) average time (hash table lookup)
                return [num_dict[complement], i]   
            num_dict[num] = i              

# Example usage:
solution = Solution()                  

nums = [2, 7, 8, 15]
target = 9
output = solution.twoSum(nums, target)   
print(output)                            
```

### Enhanced Explanation

#### 1. **Initialization:**
   - **`num_dict = {}`**
     - **Purpose:** Initializes an empty dictionary to store numbers from the `nums` list as keys and their corresponding indices as values.
     - **Reasoning:** This dictionary serves as a quick reference to check if the complement of the current number (i.e., `target - num`) has already been encountered in the list.
     - **Implication:** Utilizing a dictionary allows for constant-time (`O(1)`) lookups, which is essential for achieving the overall linear time complexity.

#### 2. **Iteration Through `nums`:**
   The core of the `twoSum` method lies in iterating through each number in the `nums` list to identify a pair that adds up to the `target`.

   - **Loop Structure:**
     ```python
     for i, num in enumerate(nums):
     ```
     - **Purpose:** Iterates over the `nums` list, obtaining both the index (`i`) and the value (`num`) of each element.
     - **Implication:** This dual access is necessary to store the index of each number in the dictionary and to return the correct pair of indices when the solution is found.

   - **Calculating the Complement:**
     ```python
     complement = target - num
     ```
     - **Purpose:** Determines the number that, when added to the current `num`, equals the `target`.
     - **Reasoning:** By calculating the complement, the method can check if this required number has already been processed and stored in the dictionary.
     - **Implication:** This step is crucial for identifying the pair of numbers that sum to the `target`.

   - **First `if` Condition: Checking for the Complement**
     ```python
     if complement in num_dict:
         return [num_dict[complement], i]
     ```
     - **Purpose:** Checks whether the calculated `complement` exists in the `num_dict`.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - **Existence Check:** If the `complement` is found in the dictionary, it means that a previous number in the list can be paired with the current `num` to reach the `target`.
       - **Immediate Return:** Upon finding such a pair, the method returns the indices of the two numbers, effectively solving the problem.
     - **Implication:** This condition allows the method to identify the solution in a single pass through the list without the need for nested loops, thereby maintaining linear time complexity.

   - **Storing the Current Number and Its Index:**
     ```python
     num_dict[num] = i
     ```
     - **Purpose:** Adds the current `num` and its index `i` to the `num_dict`.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - **Future Reference:** By storing the number and its index, the method ensures that if a future number requires this `num` as its complement, it can be quickly retrieved.
       - **Avoiding Reuse of the Same Element:** This storage happens **after** checking for the complement, preventing the same element from being used twice to form the pair.
     - **Implication:** This step is essential for the method to work correctly, ensuring that each number is only considered once and that all potential pairs are accounted for efficiently.

#### 4. **Example Walkthrough with `nums = [2, 7, 8, 15]` and `target = 9`:**

Let's walk through how the `twoSum` method processes the example to identify the correct pair of indices.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `num_dict = {}`

2. **First Iteration (i = 0, num = 2):**
   - **Calculate Complement:** `complement = 9 - 2 = 7`
   - **Check Complement:** `7` is **not** in `num_dict`.
   - **Store Current Number:** Add `2` to `num_dict` with its index `0`.
     - `num_dict = {2: 0}`
   - **State After Iteration:**
     - `num_dict = {2: 0}`

3. **Second Iteration (i = 1, num = 7):**
   - **Calculate Complement:** `complement = 9 - 7 = 2`
   - **Check Complement:** `2` **is** in `num_dict` (found at index `0`).
   - **Return Indices:** Return `[0, 1]` as the pair of indices.
   - **Final Result:** `[0, 1]`

   - **Explanation:** The method identifies that `nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9`, which matches the `target`. Hence, it returns the indices `[0, 1]`. 


### Summary of Time and Space Complexity

| **Aspect**           | **Complexity** | **Explanation**                                                                                                                                                           |
|----------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Time Complexity**  | **O(n)**        | The `twoSum` method iterates through the `nums` list exactly once using a single loop. All operations inside the loop (calculating complement, dictionary lookup, and insertion) are **O(1)** on average. Thus, the overall time complexity scales linearly with the number of elements `n` in `nums`. |
| **Space Complexity** | **O(n)**        | The method uses a dictionary `num_dict` to store number-index pairs. In the worst case, where no two numbers sum up to the target, the dictionary will store all `n` elements from `nums`. Therefore, the space used scales linearly with the input size `n`.                            |

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Efficiency Through Hashing:** Utilizing a dictionary (hash table) allows for rapid lookups, enabling the method to solve the problem in linear time.
  
- **Single Pass Solution:** By iterating through the list only once and storing necessary information on-the-fly, the method avoids the need for nested loops, which would increase time complexity.
  
- **Optimal Space Usage:** While the method does use additional space proportional to the input size, this trade-off is justified by the significant gain in time efficiency.

These characteristics make the `twoSum` method an optimal solution for scenarios where quick and efficient pair identification is required.
