**Code:**

```python
def is_anagram(word, another_word):
    # First, check if lengths are equal
    if len(word) != len(another_word):
        return False

    # Use a dictionary to count character frequencies
    count = {}

    # Count characters in 'word'
    for char in word:
        count[char] = count.get(char, 0) + 1

    # Subtract counts using 'another_word'
    for char in another_word:
        if char in count:
            count[char] -= 1
            if count[char] == 0:
                del count[char]
        else:
            return False

    # If count is empty, words are anagrams
    return len(count) == 0

# Test with large input
word = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" * 100000
another_word = "zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba" * 100000

print(is_anagram(word, another_word))
```

**Time Complexity:**

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where **n** is the length of the words.
  - Counting characters in `word` takes O(n) time.
  - Subtracting counts using `another_word` also takes O(n) time.
- **Space Complexity:** O(k), where **k** is the number of unique characters.
  - The `count` dictionary stores up to **k** key-value pairs.

---

**Explanation:**

The function `is_anagram` determines whether two words are anagrams by comparing the frequency of each character in both words. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Length Check:**

   ```python
   if len(word) != len(another_word):
       return False
   ```
   - Anagrams must be the same length.
   - If the lengths differ, the function returns `False` immediately.

2. **Counting Characters in `word`:**

   ```python
   count = {}
   for char in word:
       count[char] = count.get(char, 0) + 1
   ```
   - A dictionary `count` is initialized to store character frequencies.
   - For each character `char` in `word`:
     - `count.get(char, 0)` retrieves the current count (defaulting to 0 if `char` is not in the dictionary).
     - Increment the count for `char` by 1.

3. **Subtracting Counts Using `another_word`:**

   ```python
   for char in another_word:
       if char in count:
           count[char] -= 1
           if count[char] == 0:
               del count[char]
       else:
           return False
   ```
   - For each character `char` in `another_word`:
     - If `char` exists in `count`:
       - Decrement the count for `char` by 1.
       - If the count reaches zero, remove `char` from the dictionary.
     - If `char` does not exist in `count`:
       - This means `another_word` has a character not present in `word`.
       - Return `False`.

4. **Final Verification:**

   ```python
   return len(count) == 0
   ```
   - After processing both words:
     - If `count` is empty (`len(count) == 0`), all character counts matched.
     - Return `True`, indicating the words are anagrams.
     - If `count` is not empty, return `False`.

5. **Testing with Large Input:**

   ```python
   word = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" * 100000
   another_word = "zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba" * 100000
   ```
   - We create two large strings by repeating sequences 100,000 times.
   - This tests the function's efficiency with large inputs.

6. **Function Call:**

   ```python
   print(is_anagram(word, another_word))
   ```
   - Prints `True` if the words are anagrams, `False` otherwise.

**Alternative Approaches (Just Code):**

1. **Using Sorting:**

   ```python
   def is_anagram_sorting(word, another_word):
       return sorted(word) == sorted(another_word)

   # Example usage:
   word = "abcdefg"
   another_word = "gfedcba"
   print(is_anagram_sorting(word, another_word))
   ```

2. **Using Arrays for Character Counting (Assuming Lowercase Letters a-z):**

   ```python
   def is_anagram_arrays(word, another_word):
       if len(word) != len(another_word):
           return False

       count = [0] * 26  # For letters a-z

       for char in word:
           index = ord(char) - ord('a')
           count[index] += 1

       for char in another_word:
           index = ord(char) - ord('a')
           count[index] -= 1

       for c in count:
           if c != 0:
               return False

       return True

   # Example usage:
   word = "listen"
   another_word = "silent"
   print(is_anagram_arrays(word, another_word))
   ```

3. **Using Fixed-Size Hashtable for ASCII Characters:**

   ```python
   def is_anagram_ascii(word, another_word):
       if len(word) != len(another_word):
           return False

       count = [0] * 256  # For extended ASCII characters

       for char in word:
           count[ord(char)] += 1

       for char in another_word:
           count[ord(char)] -= 1

       for c in count:
           if c != 0:
               return False

       return True

   # Example usage:
   word = "anagram"
   another_word = "nagaram"
   print(is_anagram_ascii(word, another_word))
   ```

4. **Using Frequency Dictionaries (Without Built-in Methods):**

   ```python
   def is_anagram_manual_dict(word, another_word):
       if len(word) != len(another_word):
           return False

       count_word = {}
       count_another = {}

       for char in word:
           if char in count_word:
               count_word[char] += 1
           else:
               count_word[char] = 1

       for char in another_word:
           if char in count_another:
               count_another[char] += 1
           else:
               count_another[char] = 1

       return count_word == count_another

   # Example usage:
   word = "triangle"
   another_word = "integral"
   print(is_anagram_manual_dict(word, another_word))
   ```

# Time and Space Complexity
---

### 1. **Using Sorting:**

```python
def is_anagram_sorting(word, another_word):
    return sorted(word) == sorted(another_word)
```

**Time Complexity:**

- **O(n log n)**, where **n** is the length of the words.
  - Sorting each word takes O(n log n) time.
  - Comparing the two sorted lists takes O(n) time.

**Space Complexity:**

- **O(n)**
  - The sorted lists create copies of the original strings, requiring additional space proportional to the input size.

---

### 2. **Using Arrays for Character Counting (Assuming Lowercase Letters a-z):**

```python
def is_anagram_arrays(word, another_word):
    if len(word) != len(another_word):
        return False

    count = [0] * 26  # For letters a-z

    for char in word:
        index = ord(char) - ord('a')
        count[index] += 1

    for char in another_word:
        index = ord(char) - ord('a')
        count[index] -= 1

    for c in count:
        if c != 0:
            return False

    return True
```

**Time Complexity:**

- **O(n)**, where **n** is the length of the words.
  - Counting characters in both words takes O(n) time.
  - Checking the counts in the fixed-size array takes O(1) time (since the array size is constant).

**Space Complexity:**

- **O(1)**
  - The count array has a fixed size of 26 elements, regardless of the input size.

### 3. **Using Fixed-Size Hashtable for ASCII Characters:**

```python
def is_anagram_ascii(word, another_word):
    if len(word) != len(another_word):
        return False

    count = [0] * 256  # For extended ASCII characters

    for char in word:
        count[ord(char)] += 1

    for char in another_word:
        count[ord(char)] -= 1

    for c in count:
        if c != 0:
            return False

    return True
```

**Time Complexity:**

- **O(n)**
  - Counting characters in both words takes O(n) time.
  - Checking the counts in the fixed-size array takes O(1) time.

**Space Complexity:**

- **O(1)**
  - The count array has a fixed size of 256 elements.

### 4. **Using Frequency Dictionaries (Without Built-in Methods):**

```python
def is_anagram_manual_dict(word, another_word):
    if len(word) != len(another_word):
        return False

    count_word = {}
    count_another = {}

    for char in word:
        if char in count_word:
            count_word[char] += 1
        else:
            count_word[char] = 1

    for char in another_word:
        if char in count_another:
            count_another[char] += 1
        else:
            count_another[char] = 1

    return count_word == count_another
```

**Time Complexity:**

- **O(n)**, where **n** is the length of the words.
  - Building the frequency dictionaries takes O(n) time.
  - Comparing the two dictionaries takes O(k) time, where **k** is the number of unique characters (since dictionary comparison checks each key).

**Space Complexity:**

- **O(k)**
  - The dictionaries store counts for up to **k** unique characters in the words.

---

### **Summary:**

- **Sorting Approach:**
  - **Pros:** Simple and easy to implement.
  - **Cons:** Higher time complexity (O(n log n)), less efficient for large inputs.

- **Counting with Arrays:**
  - **Pros:** Efficient time complexity (O(n)), constant space complexity (O(1)).
  - **Cons:** Limited to specific character sets (e.g., lowercase letters a-z).

- **Counting with Fixed-Size Hashtable:**
  - **Pros:** Handles extended ASCII characters, efficient time complexity.
  - **Cons:** Fixed space usage of 256 elements, which is acceptable but not minimal.

- **Counting with Dictionaries:**
  - **Pros:** Flexible for any character set, efficient time complexity.
  - **Cons:** Space complexity depends on the number of unique characters.

---
The counting methods generally offer better performance for large inputs due to their linear time complexity. The sorting method, while straightforward, may not be as efficient for very large datasets.
