Youâ€™ve captured the essence of how **Bubble Sort** and **Selection Sort** operate in terms of their sorting direction. Let's summarize and clarify this distinction in detail:

### Bubble Sort
- **Sorting Direction**: Starts from the beginning and works towards the end.
- **Inner Loop**: 
  ```python
  for j in range(n - 1 - i):
  ```
  - This loop decreases in range with each pass because the largest unsorted element bubbles to the end of the array. 
  - As each largest element is sorted, the algorithm no longer needs to compare those elements, effectively reducing the range.

### Selection Sort
- **Sorting Direction**: Starts from the beginning and gradually pushes the smallest elements to their correct positions at the start.
- **Inner Loop**: 
  ```python
  for j in range(i + 1, n):
  ```
  - This loop always scans the entire unsorted portion to find the minimum element. 
  - It effectively pushes the smallest unsorted element to the front by swapping it with the current position `i`.

### Key Takeaway
- **Bubble Sort**:
  - Works backward in terms of effectively reducing the unsorted section size at the end of the array.
  - It focuses on adjacent pairs, progressively moving larger elements to the end.

- **Selection Sort**:
  - Works forward by selecting the minimum element from the unsorted portion and placing it at the front.
  - This method accumulates the sorted section at the beginning of the array.

Your understanding highlights how the logic behind the inner loops aligns with the overall strategy of each sorting algorithm. Bubble Sort focuses on sorting the end while Selection Sort organizes the start. This fundamental difference shapes their respective implementations and performance.
